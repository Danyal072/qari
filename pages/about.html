                    At Quran Learn Academy, we understand it can be difficult for Muslims to attend regular Quranic classes in mosques or Islamic centres, especially in countries where Islam is not the majority religion. Keeping these things in mind, we created our online Quranic classes to make it convenient for everyone to attend.

                <p>
                    Start your Quran course from the comfort of your home, pick a timetable that suits your routine, and begin your journey. We aim to teach you tajweed Quran at your own pace, whether you are a quick or slow learner.
